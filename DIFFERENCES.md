# Differences from competitest.nvim

This file tracks where `tuna.nvim` intentionally diverges from or improves on
[competitest.nvim](https://github.com/xeluxee/competitest.nvim), the plugin it is
a successor to. It's a living document — we add to it as decisions are made, and
it will seed the "differences / why switch" section of the final README.

## UI: native APIs instead of `nui.nvim`

📌 **Decision:** tuna builds its UI on Neovim's native `vim.api` floating windows
and splits. It does **not** depend on `nui.nvim`.

**Why:** competitest.nvim requires `nui.nvim` for every piece of its UI (testcase
editor, picker, input prompt, runner popup/split). As of Neovim 0.12 the core UI
(`ui2`, default float borders, etc.) covers most of what `nui.nvim` was used for,
and the community trend in 2025–2026 is to drop the abstraction layer in favor of
native floats (or, where a toolkit is wanted, `snacks.nvim`). Going native keeps
startup lean and removes a runtime dependency, which matches tuna's goals of
speed and minimal overhead.

**Trade-off:** we reimplement the recursive layout engine and popup/split
plumbing that competitest got for free from `nui.nvim`. The layout logic is small
and ports cleanly.

**Consequence:** tuna targets a more recent Neovim baseline than competitest's
0.5+. Exact minimum TBD when the UI modules land.

## Testcase storage: fully user-customizable layout

✅ **Decision:** the on-disk testcase layout is a user choice, with multiple
options supported out of the box rather than one imposed structure.
(Config keys + all three storage backends implemented and tested; the
`convert` command that exposes them to users is wired up in step 9.)

competitest exposes a single boolean `testcases_use_single_file` to pick between
two storage modes. tuna replaces it with a `testcases_storage` enum offering
**three** modes:

| `testcases_storage` | layout | naming option(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"files"` (default) | a pair of text files per testcase, beside the source | `testcases_input_file_format`, `testcases_output_file_format` |
| `"single_file"` | one msgpack-encoded file | `testcases_single_file_format` |
| `"directory"` | one sub-directory per testcase | `testcases_directory_format`, `testcases_directory_input`, `testcases_directory_output` |

The `"directory"` mode (e.g. `tests/0/input.txt` + `output.txt`) is new — it
isn't available in competitest at all. `testcases_auto_detect` falls back to the
other modes when the configured one finds nothing. The `convert` command can
move testcases **between any two of the three modes**, including to/from the new
`directory` mode (competitest only converts files ↔ single-file).

**Why:** different users and judges expect different layouts; making it
configurable avoids forcing a migration on anyone coming from either convention.

## Smaller config differences

📌 Recorded as we port `config.lua`, to mention in the final README:

- **No `nui.nvim` border options.** competitest's `floating_border_highlight`
  (a nui concept) is dropped; `floating_border` is passed straight to
  `nvim_open_win`.
- **Python default is `python3`.** competitest defaults the Python run command
  to `python`, which is Python 2 on some systems; tuna uses `python3`.
- **Local config search.** Both plugins walk up the directory tree for a local
  config file; tuna uses `vim.fs.find(..., { upward = true })` instead of a
  hand-rolled loop. (Behaviour parity — noted only as an implementation note.)
- **Single-file storage read as raw bytes.** competitest reads its msgpack
  single-file through a helper that rewrites CRLF→LF, which can corrupt the
  binary payload; tuna reads it verbatim (`utils.read_file(path, true)`).

## Receive: live listener status for lualine

✅ **Decision:** `receive.lua` exposes `status()`, `is_receiving()` and `mode()`,
and `require("tuna").lualine_component` renders `status()` — an empty string when
idle, or e.g. `🐟 receiving contest` while the listener is live.

**Why:** competitest only offers `show_status()`, a one-shot notification you have
to ask for. With a persistent receive mode it's easy to forget the listener is
running (or to think it is when it isn't). Surfacing the state continuously in the
statusline is a small but real quality-of-life win, and it costs nothing — the
component is just a string read from module state.
